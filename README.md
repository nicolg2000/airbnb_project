*********AIRBNB ANALYSIS*********


Overview:


This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to derive insights into rental trends, pricing dynamics, and other factors influencing the Airbnb market. By utilizing Python scripting, data preprocessing techniques, visualization tools, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Streamlit for interactive web apps, MongoDB for database management, and PowerBI or Tableau for advanced visualization, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of the Airbnb ecosystem.


Skills Developed:

* Python Scripting: Leveraging Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
  
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.
  
* Visualization: Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visual representations of data.
  
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
  
* Streamlit: Building interactive web applications for data visualization and exploration.
  
* MongoDB: Storing and managing Airbnb data in a NoSQL database for efficient retrieval and analysis.
  
* PowerBI or Tableau: Creating dynamic and insightful dashboards for data visualization and reporting.
  


  
Project Structure:
